# NRR-DL-Calculator
This is a folder having multiple files.
One file is NRRCalculator.cpp, which is used to calculate NRR of any team in the tournament.
Also another file DLCalculator.cpp can be used to calculate target score or match decision by DL method.
Later one can be modified further, if you get some idea, just fork and commit your changes.

Thank you for reading !!!
